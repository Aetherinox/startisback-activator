# About

`StartIsBack` returns Windows 10 and Windows 8 to a real fully featured start menu and start button, behaving exactly like the ones in Windows 7.

<br />

Be aware that there are different programs for different versions of Windows. If you are looking to restore the start menu in Windows 11, check out [StartAllBack](https://github.com/Aetherinox/startallback-activator).

<br />

| Program | Operating System |
| --- | --- |
| [StartIsBack](https://github.com/Aetherinox/startisback-activator) | Windows 8, 10 |
| [StartAllBack](https://github.com/Aetherinox/startallback-activator) | Windows 11 |

<br />

This generator has been developed to work on the following versions:
- StartIsBack v2.x

# Notice

Developer holds no responsibility with what people decide to do with this app. It was developed strictly for demonstration purposes only.
Developed under the following conditions:

- Visual Studio 2022 (17.6.5)
- v4.8.0 .NET Framework
- C# language

<br />

<br />

# Usage

If you wish to simply use the keygen, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Aetherinox/startisback-activator/releases) section and download the latest binary as a `zip` or `rar`. The download is a single `exe`.

- `SIBActivator.exe`

<br />

<br />

# Build

Download the source files and launch the `.csproj` project file in Visual Studio.

If you decide to modify or re-build my code, you are to not re-distribute. These sources are for learning purposes and should not be used in order to take advantage of others.

# Signed Releases

As of `v1.0.0.0` and onwards, binaries are GPG signed with the key `CB5C4C30CD0D4028`. You can find the key available on most keyservers:

- [pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.mit.edu/)
- [keyserver.ubuntu.com](keyserver.ubuntu.com)
- [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org)

Binaries are also signed with a certificate which has the Thumbprint `70575bdfb02b3f1b45a37431bef9a8c9933a4ace`. If you downloaded this elsewhere on the internet and the binary is not signed with that certificate serial number; **IT IS NOT MINE**. You should delete it.

# Virus Scans

Unfortunately, virus scanners such as VirusTotal can report false positives. There's not much control I have over that. These websites will also attempt to detect keygens; sometimes you can get by it, and sometimes you can't.

The only option I'd have is to contact these websites and tell them that it's a false positive, but I'm writing a keygen; I highly doubt they're going to be happy with doing anything.

VirusTotal reported that there were a few hits on this, and the results are odd. I've spent a few hours trying to see exactly what parts of the code are triggering these specific hits, but the funny thing is that when I remove code, it actually hits for even more "viruses".

The files are clean, and contain no malware. I may spend a full day attempting to see what exactly triggers this, but my initial attempt did nothing but make it add even more.

At one point, I even made a completely empty .DLL with the standard DLL headers, signed it with my certificate and uploaded that. VirusTotal reported that my signature itself was `TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen`. Which is just ridiuclous.
